##[Here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cipq53lLlUR/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D) is a demo video of this project

It was my college project for the mobile app development course.

The idea is to create a webserver and online database (cloud) which I can manage via ESP32 microcontroller, website or mobile application wherever I am. Based on the state and changes in the database, behavioural changes occur on the physical device. The so-called Internet of Things (IoT).
